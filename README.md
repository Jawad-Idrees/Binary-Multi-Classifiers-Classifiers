# Naive-Bayesian-vs-Vanilla-Network-Classifier
The model builds 2 classifier models, 1 is Naive Bayesian and the other is Vanilla Neural Network classifier. 
The dataset used is titanic dataset. Both the models perform well but the Naive bayes performs better with 100 accuracy. 
Techniques like Feature Engineering or Feature Selection have been skipped as the purpose was to compare the performance of the 
two models.

The Naive Bayesian Classifer has 100% accuracy while Vanilla Neural Network showed 96-97% accuracy with 2 layers 
(1st of 128 units and 2nd of 64 units). The metrics included with the model that are precision, 
recall, loss seem erratic at points as the model size and batch size is small.
